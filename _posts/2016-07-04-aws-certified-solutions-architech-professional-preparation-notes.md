- There is a limit on sending emails (outgoing smtp) from the EC2 (hard to find exact number of the limit), for both auto-assigned public IP and static ElasticIP addresses. This limit can be lifted off by submitting a request form.
- ElasticIP addreses can have their reverse record set by submitting a request form.
- There is a limit of number of on demand and reserved instances that can be run. The limit is per instance type. For all instances type, reserved limit is 20. On demand limit varies from 20 (for smaller instances like t2.micro) to 2 (for larger instaces like i2.8xlarge)
